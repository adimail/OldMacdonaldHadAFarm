# Old MacDonald Had a Farm

A charming C++ code where farm animals come to life through object-oriented programming and templates.

## Overview

Why should kids have all the fun

### 1. Classes and Objects (OOP)

- **Classes**: The code defines classes for farm animals (`FarmAnimal`, `Cow`, `Chicken`, `Pig`, `Duck`) and an encapsulating template class (`OldMacDonald`) for the song.

- **Objects**: Specific farm animals are represented as objects of their respective classes, allowing for individual characteristics and behaviors.

### 2. Inheritance (OOP)

- **Inheritance**: The code employs inheritance to create derived animal classes, inheriting properties and methods from the base class (`FarmAnimal`). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical organization.

### 3. Polymorphism (OOP)

- **Polymorphism**: The base class `FarmAnimal` declares a virtual method (`sing()`), and derived classes override it. This enables polymorphic behavior when singing the song for various animals.

### 4. Templates (C++)

- **Templates**: The `OldMacDonald` class is a template class, allowing it to work with different data types for animal sounds. This ensures flexibility and code reusability.

### 5. Standard Library Usage (C++)

- **Standard Library**: The code incorporates elements from the C++ Standard Library, such as `iostream`, `vector`, and `string`, to handle input/output, data storage, and string manipulation.

### 6. Constructor Initialization Lists (C++)

- **Constructor Initialization Lists**: Member variables in constructors are efficiently initialized using initialization lists, improving code performance.

### 7. Dynamic Memory Allocation (C++)

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The code uses pointers and a vector to manage objects dynamically, allowing for polymorphism when singing the song for farm animals.

### 8. Access Specifiers (OOP)

- **Access Specifiers**: Access specifiers (`public`, `protected`) are used to control member variable visibility and access in the classes.
